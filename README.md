# JurisPrudent-AI

Welcome to JurisPrudent-AI, an innovative open-source initiative aimed at leveraging the power of artificial intelligence to redefine the landscape of legal analysis, decision-making, and precedent research. By harnessing the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Claude-3, JurisPrudent-AI seeks to provide legal professionals, scholars, and enthusiasts with a tool that can analyze legal documents, case facts, and issues, ultimately offering reasoned decisions along with pertinent precedents.

## Project Status
